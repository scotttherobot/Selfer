## Selfer

Remember DailyBooth? It was like an online photobooth where you could take photos online? Yeah, well, they went out of business in like the two-thousands, and I missed it terribly.
So after completing the first Rails blog tutorial, I decided to turn that code into a clone of Dailybooth.

And that's what this is. You can register, create a profile, and start posting selfies and stuff right from
your browser.

Features:
* Profiles with image avatars, etc
* Image attachment using paperclip
* public feed of all photos from all users
* per-user feed
* TODO: follow system and customized dash
